This book showed me what Goggins came from and what he is really about. It showed me that more than what I thought was possible. It is possible to transcend certain physical pain and be an animal daily. It is all in the mind, but there are other matters too like making sure the running shoes you got will hold up for a 100 mile race. But Goggins empahsizes the mind and states that everything he does is to access the power of his mind and discover new things inside of it. I believe he is an extreme personality that was born out of a lot of abuse, childhood trauma, and a need for significance. Its interesting that he says towards the end of the book that he has missed out on a lot. But look at what he has accomplished and he has endeared himself to many of us.
