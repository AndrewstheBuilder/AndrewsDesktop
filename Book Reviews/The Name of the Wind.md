Probably the best fantasy book I have ever read. There are so many subtle things in the book and incredible characters. It reads a little dry at first but it builds the world extremely well and provides a sense of realism to it like you are really there. The power of the character in this book is also very deep. Naming. The power of names. What does it mean to truly understand something? Mastery = Naming. 
Everything the author does in the first few chapters is what I would call the setup. There are multiple climaxes throughtout the book and they have tensions and subtleties from what happened in the previous chapter, but at the same time you don't have to remember all of those things to enjoy the story.
