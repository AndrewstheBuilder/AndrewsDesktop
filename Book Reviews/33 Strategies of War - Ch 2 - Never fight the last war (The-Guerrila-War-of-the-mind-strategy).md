Declare war on yourself against fighting the last war. The idea is simple the same tactics you used before will not get the same results again, but Robert delivers this idea with nuance. It really brings about the nature of flowing from one subject to another with a lot of good examples. Robert says to be like a child and don't obsess over things that cannot be changed. Part of it is that its the obsession that influences people to fight the last war instead of seeing a thing with fresh eyes. You have to forget the last war because you don't have the distance or detachment to properly reflect on it. 
Favorite Quote from this chapter:
"It is a disease to be obsessed by the thought of winning. It is also a disease to be obsessed with the thought of employing your swordsmanship. So it is to be obsessed by the thought of using everything you have learned, and to be obsessed by the thought of attacking. It is also a disease to be obsessed and stuck with the thought of ridding yourself of any of these diseases. A disease here is an obsessed mind that dwells on one thing. Because all these diseases are in your mind, you must get rid of them to put your mind in order." - Takuan, Japan, 1573-1645
