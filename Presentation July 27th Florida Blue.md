- Introduction 
	- I am part of the claims processing team under priya rajimani
	- Claims Processing is the heart and soul of insurance and it is how we bring value to our customers
	- Inside the claims processing team I am in the ICB track.
		- The ICB Track pulls insurance product information from Diamond and adds narratives to it.
		- Narratives are the plain english of the insurance product services, benefits, and other information. This product provides customer satisfaction in that it is clear as day what exactly they are paying for. So when the customer why a certain claim costs this much claimsConnect can pull up that information. 
	- I work on the front end and backend user stories for the claimsConnect application. And I primarily code in Springboot which is Java and React which is JavaScript.
