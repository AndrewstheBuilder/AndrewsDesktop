- When I am bored or stressed. I appear to rush things. I come to conclusions quickly. I rush my thoughts because I am trying to move on to the next thing quickly(stressed) or I believe that none of this matters (bored). True freedom from these comes from engaging in deep work. I think you just need to force yourself to go through the motions sometimes to get into that flow. Deep work is important. 
- Motivation also comes when you know you have to get something done. Like doing chores. So deep work comes from there as well. It is good to have leverages like money and pride to keep motivation high. I wouldn't even be working on application development if it wasn't for this internship. I probably would have been stuck worrying about something stupid, reading a book, trying to figure out what I can do at the beach, figure out something to do for fun, or try my hand again at algorithms or reverse engineering. 
- I realize that I do like this comp sci stuff. But none of it seems to be a perfect fit. I am not motivated particularly to any one thing in comp sci. I like reversing, I like algorithms, I like development. As a result I do a bit of everything and end up mastering nothing. I want to solve the mysteries of this universe. Comp Sci is sort of like the playground for that.
